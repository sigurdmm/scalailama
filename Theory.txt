## Task 1d: Scala introduction
The INTEGER type can store a smaller amount of integers, that is, to 2.1 billion numbers. This uses 2^31-1 bits to represent numbers.
The BIGINT type can store even bigger numbers and support larger numbers to 20 digits. This uses 2^63-1 bits to represent numbers.

## Task 2: Concurrency in Scala
Deadlock is when you have concurrent operations that have become stuck. An example of this is when you have two threads that depends on the result of each other so none may continue.
One way to prevent deadlock in concurrency is to have a timeout. This way, if two transactions are stuck because of each other, one of them may cancel and restart which will remove the deadlock.
